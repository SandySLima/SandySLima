## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a beginner programmer currently studying Systems Analysis and Development at the Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology of SÃ£o Paulo. 

Iâ€™m focusing on learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C#, and Iâ€™m eager to challenge myself, starting with simple projects and gradually progressing to more advanced ones.

I became interested in technology when I realized how transformative it can be for society, and I want to learn and improve to become a skilled professional, contributing to my future team and company. Iâ€™m excited to collaborate and learn from others in the tech community.
